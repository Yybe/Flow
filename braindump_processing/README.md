# Brain Dump Processing System

## Overview
This folder contains the complete brain dump processing system that transforms unstructured text input into organized, structured notes using AI. The system is designed to be portable and can be easily integrated into any Flutter project.

## What is Brain Dump?
Brain dump is an AI-powered feature that takes messy, unstructured text input (like "buy milk eggs bread call mom dentist tomorrow 2pm need tomatos lettus cheeze clean room homework due monday") and intelligently organizes it into structured notes with proper categorization, spelling correction, and consolidation.

## Key Features
- **AI-First Processing**: Uses Google Gemini AI for intelligent text organization
- **Content Validation**: Filters out garbage input and keyboard mashing
- **Smart Consolidation**: Groups similar items (e.g., all food items into one shopping list)
- **Spelling Correction**: Fixes common typos intelligently
- **Fallback Parser**: Local parser as backup when AI fails
- **Reroll Functionality**: Re-process notes with original input
- **Multiple Note Types**: Supports todo, list, event, and paragraph notes

## Files Included

### Core Processing Files
1. **`ai_service.dart`** - Main AI processing service
2. **`note_model.dart`** - Data models for structured notes
3. **`brain_dump_parser.dart`** - Fallback parser for when AI fails

### Documentation
4. **`README.md`** - This documentation file
5. **`INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Step-by-step integration instructions
6. **`API_REFERENCE.md`** - Complete API documentation
7. **`EXAMPLES.md`** - Usage examples and test cases

## Quick Start

### Dependencies Required
Add these to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^1.1.0
  uuid: ^4.2.1
  flutter: 
    sdk: flutter
```

### Basic Usage
```dart
import 'ai_service.dart';
import 'note_model.dart';

// Initialize the service
final aiService = AIService();

// Process text
final notes = await aiService.organizeText("buy milk call mom clean room");

// Result: List<Note> with organized, structured notes
```

## Input/Output Examples

### Input
```
"buy milk eggs bread call mom dentist tomorrow 2pm need tomatos lettus cheeze clean room homework due monday"
```

### Output
```dart
[
  Note(
    title: "Shopping List",
    type: NoteType.list,
    content: ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bread", "Tomatoes", "Lettuce", "Cheese"]
  ),
  Note(
    title: "Call Mom", 
    type: NoteType.event,
    content: ["Call mom"]
  ),
  Note(
    title: "Dentist Appointment",
    type: NoteType.event, 
    content: ["Dentist appointment at 2:00 PM"],
    date: DateTime(2024, 1, 15) // tomorrow's date
  ),
  Note(
    title: "Home & School Tasks",
    type: NoteType.todo,
    content: ["Clean room", "Homework due Monday"]
  )
]
```

## Integration Steps

1. **Copy Files**: Copy the 3 core files to your project
2. **Add Dependencies**: Update your pubspec.yaml
3. **Configure API**: Set your Gemini API key in ai_service.dart
4. **Import & Use**: Import AIService and start processing text

## API Key Setup
You'll need a Google Gemini API key. Get one from:
https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

Replace the API key in `ai_service.dart`:
```dart
static const String _apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
```

## Advanced Features

### Content Quality Validation
The system automatically filters out:
- Keyboard mashing (qwerty, asdf, hjkl patterns)
- Random letter sequences
- Spam content
- Very short meaningless input

### Smart Consolidation
- Groups all food items into one shopping list
- Combines similar tasks into todo lists
- Separates events with specific times
- Maintains context and relationships

### Reroll Functionality
```dart
// Reprocess a note with its original input
final newNotes = await aiService.rerollNote(existingNote);
```

### Clarification System
```dart
// Analyze if input needs clarification
final analysis = aiService.analyzeForClarification(text);
if (analysis['needsClarification']) {
  // Show questions to user, then process with clarifications
  final notes = await aiService.organizeWithClarification(text, clarifications);
}
```

## Performance
- Average processing time: 1-3 seconds
- Fallback processing: <100ms
- Memory efficient with minimal dependencies
- Optimized for mobile devices

## Error Handling
The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network failures fall back to local parser
- Invalid API responses trigger retry logic
- Malformed input gets helpful error messages
- All errors are logged for debugging

## Testing
The system has been tested with:
- Various input formats and lengths
- Edge cases and garbage input
- Network failure scenarios
- Different content types and languages

## Support

- `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed setup
- `API_REFERENCE.md` for method documentation
- `EXAMPLES.md` for more usage examples
